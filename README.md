# FIS Spring-Boot AMQ Producer

This project contains a FIS 2.0 Spring-Boot application that connects to an A-MQ xPaaS message broker and use Camel to 
produce transacted or non-transacted messages.
The application is exposed outside OpenShift via a route resource.

### Prerequisites

It is assumed that:
- OpenShift platform is already running, if not you can find details how to [Install OpenShift at your site](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.5/install_config/index.html) or setup a [local OpenShift cluster using the CDK](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_container_development_kit/3.1/html/getting_started_guide/index)
- Your system is configured for Fabric8 Maven Workflow, if not you can find a [Get Started Guide](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en/red-hat-jboss-middleware-for-openshift/3/single/red-hat-jboss-fuse-integration-services-20-for-openshift/)
- The Red Hat JBoss A-MQ xPaaS product should already be installed and running on your OpenShift installation, one simple way to run a A-MQ service is following the documentation of the A-MQ xPaaS image for OpenShift related to the `amq63-basic` template. Use the `ACTIVEMQ_SERVICE_NAME` environment variable on the deployment configuration to configure the service hosting the AMQ broker.

### Customizing the exposed OpenShift route

The `src/main/fabric8/route.yml` route definition snipet contains:

	metadata:
	  annotations:
	    haproxy.router.openshift.io/timeout: 30m
	spec:
	  host: jms-service.apps.ocp.rhlab.ovh
	  to:
	    kind: Service
	    name: fis-amq-producer

You have to customize the exposed `host` FQDN according to your OpenShift environment.

### Customizing the xPaaS AMQ broker connection parameters

The `src/main/fabric8/deployment.yml` deployment definition snipt contains these environment variables:

	env:
       - name: ACTIVEMQ_SERVICE_NAME
         value: amq63-broker-amq-tcp
       - name: ACTIVEMQ_BROKER_USERNAME
         value: amq
       - name: ACTIVEMQ_BROKER_PASSWORD
         value: amq@ocp
       - name: ACTIVEMQ_POOL_MAX_CONNECTIONS
         value: 10

You may adapt these environment variables values according to your AMQ xPaaS broker instance.

### Building

The project can be built with

    mvn clean install

### Running the application in OpenShift

The following command will package your app and run it on OpenShift:

    mvn fabric8:deploy

To list all the running pods:

    oc get pods
    
To list the application route:

	oc get route fis-amq-producer

Then find the name of the pod that runs this application, and output the logs from the running pods with:

    oc logs <name of pod>

You can also use the openshift [web console](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.1/getting_started/developers/developers_console.html#tutorial-video) to manage the
running pods, and view logs and much more.

### Testing the application

The application can be tested from any web browser or using the `curl` and `HTTPie` tools.

	Usage:
	http://<host>:<service_port>/produceJmsMessage?[OPTIONS]
	Options:
	[destination         queue:.. | topic:..] - producer destination; mandatory
	[messageCount                          N] - number of messages to send; default 1000
	[messageSize                           N] - message size in bytes; default 5120 text message
	[msgTTL                                N] - message TTL in milliseconds; default 86400000
	[msgGroupID                           ..] - JMS message group identifier
	[persistent                 true | false] - use persistent or non persistent messages; default true
	[transacted                 true | false] - use transaction in sending JMS messages; default true
	[transactionBatchSize                  N] - use to send transaction batches of size N; default 10
	
	Example:
	http --timeout=120 'http://jms-service.apps.ocp.rhlab.ovh/producejmsmessage?destination=queue:TRANSACTED.TEST1&messageCount=50000&transactionBatchSize=100'
